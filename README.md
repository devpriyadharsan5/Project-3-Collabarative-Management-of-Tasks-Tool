# Project-3-Collabarative-Management-of-Tasks-Tool

You are responsible for implementing the following user stories for a tool that allows for the collaborative
management of tasks:

i. A user signs into their online account, creates a task or edits a task previously created. For now, a
task consists of a title, a description, and an optional link to a resource (e.g., to a website or an
online image), and optional contextual annotations (e.g., tags that further describe the task, such as
‘important’, ‘project X’). The user may decide to make the task private-only access, to share it with
a group, or to make it publicly accessible. A user signs into their online account and may pick a task
and, mark it as completed.

ii. Any user may create and manage groups which can be used to share tasks within this group. Any
user who creates a group automatically owns this group and can then also invite other users (or
remove them). 


This is a collaborative project management tool designed to streamline team tasks and improve communication.

The application is built using modern web technologies, including ReactJS, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.

Users can create groups and assign tasks to members, while also having the ability to update or delete their assigned tasks.

The owner of the application has complete control over the management of tasks and groups.

Authentication is handled using Firebase, ensuring secure access to the application.

The user interface is designed using Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The application's architecture is structured using a REST API, facilitating data management and persistency.

The README file provides detailed instructions on how to run and use the application.

To get started, simply clone the repository, install the necessary dependencies, and follow the instructions in the README file.
