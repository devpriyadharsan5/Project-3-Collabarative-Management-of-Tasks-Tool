# CS615 Project-3-Collabarative-Management-of-Tasks-Tool

You are responsible for implementing the following user stories for a tool that allows for the collaborative
management of tasks:

i. A user signs into their online account, creates a task or edits a task previously created. For now, a
task consists of a title, a description, and an optional link to a resource (e.g., to a website or an
online image), and optional contextual annotations (e.g., tags that further describe the task, such as
‘important’, ‘project X’). The user may decide to make the task private-only access, to share it with
a group, or to make it publicly accessible. A user signs into their online account and may pick a task
and, mark it as completed.

ii. Any user may create and manage groups which can be used to share tasks within this group. Any
user who creates a group automatically owns this group and can then also invite other users (or
remove them).

# Introduction 
**Collaborative Management of Tasks Tool** is designed to assist teams in a more efficient way by managing their projects by splitting tasks among team members and assigning them to specific people or groups. The application allows you to create groups to which you can assign various tasks simply by using the group name or ID. The user has the ability to update or delete the tasks assigned to them, while the application's owner has complete control over it.
	
The application's frontend is designed using React JS, a popular JavaScript toolkit for creating user interfaces. HTML is used to structure the content of the pages, while CSS is used to style the pages. JavaScript is used to add interactivity to the pages, such as handling user input and updating the task list. The Bootstrap framework is used to provide a responsive design and pre-built UI components. Node.js, a popular JavaScript runtime for developing scalable server-side applications, is used to build the backend. MongoDB is utilized as the database to store the application's data. For authentication, Firebase is used.
