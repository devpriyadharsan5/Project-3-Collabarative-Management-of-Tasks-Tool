# Project-3-Collabarative-Management-of-Tasks-Tool

You are responsible for implementing the following user stories for a tool that allows for the collaborative
management of tasks:

i. A user signs into their online account, creates a task or edits a task previously created. For now, a
task consists of a title, a description, and an optional link to a resource (e.g., to a website or an
online image), and optional contextual annotations (e.g., tags that further describe the task, such as
‘important’, ‘project X’). The user may decide to make the task private-only access, to share it with
a group, or to make it publicly accessible. A user signs into their online account and may pick a task
and, mark it as completed.

ii. Any user may create and manage groups which can be used to share tasks within this group. Any
user who creates a group automatically owns this group and can then also invite other users (or
remove them).
